# Security Policy for Memory Pod Fabric (MPF)

This document outlines the security procedures and policies for the Memory Pod Fabric protocol specification and reference implementations.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The MPF team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please email security@amotivv.com with the subject "MPF SECURITY VULNERABILITY". Include the following information:

- Type of issue
- Location of the affected source code
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

## Response Process

The MPF team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 72 hours, including:

- Confirmation of the issue and its severity
- Whether the issue qualifies for a security advisory
- Expected timeline for a fix or mitigation

For critical vulnerabilities, we strive to release patches as quickly as possible.

## Disclosure Policy

When the MPF team receives a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all affected versions
4. Release patches as appropriate

## Security Best Practices for Implementers

If you are implementing the MPF protocol, we recommend:

- Regularly update to the latest version of the specification and reference implementations
- Follow the security guidelines in the specification, particularly regarding:
  - Capability token validation
  - Cryptographic verification
  - Access control enforcement
  - Proper authentication methods
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate all inputs, especially in capability tokens and query parameters
- Use secure defaults for all configuration options

## Security Considerations in the Protocol

The MPF protocol includes several security features by design:

- **Capability-based Security**: Fine-grained permissions using JWT tokens
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Merkle tree audit trails for tamper evidence
- **Token Revocation**: Methods for invalidating compromised tokens
- **Delegated Authentication**: Support for various authentication schemes

## Security Updates

Security updates will be announced via:

- Security advisories in the GitHub repository
- Email notifications to the working group

## Attribution

We credit reporters of security issues according to their disclosure preferences.
