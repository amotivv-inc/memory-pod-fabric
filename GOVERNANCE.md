# Memory Pod Fabric (MPF) Governance

This document outlines the governance structure for the Memory Pod Fabric (MPF) protocol specification and related implementations.

## Working Group

The Memory Pod Fabric protocol is governed by a community working group that includes representatives from various organizations and individual contributors. The working group is responsible for:

- Maintaining and evolving the MPF specification
- Reviewing and accepting changes to the specification
- Determining the release schedule and versioning
- Ensuring compatibility and interoperability
- Managing the overall direction of the protocol

## Current Working Group Members

- amotivv, inc - Project Initiator
- (Additional members to be added as the community grows)

## Decision-Making Process

The MPF working group follows a consensus-seeking decision-making process:

1. **Proposals**: Any community member can propose changes through GitHub issues or pull requests
2. **Discussion**: Proposals are discussed openly in GitHub issues, community calls, or other public forums
3. **Refinement**: Proposals are refined based on community feedback
4. **Consensus**: The working group seeks consensus on proposals before acceptance
5. **Implementation**: Accepted proposals are incorporated into the specification

## Meetings

The working group holds regular public meetings to discuss development, review proposals, and make decisions. Meeting information:

- Frequency: Bi-weekly (subject to change based on activity)
- Location: Virtual (link to be provided)
- Notes: Published after each meeting in the repository

## Specification Versioning

The MPF specification follows semantic versioning:

- **Major versions** (1.0, 2.0): Introduce breaking changes
- **Minor versions** (1.1, 1.2): Add new features in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch versions** (1.1.1, 1.1.2): Backward-compatible bug fixes and clarifications

## Joining the Working Group

Organizations and individuals interested in joining the working group should:

1. Actively participate in the community
2. Demonstrate commitment to the protocol's success
3. Contribute meaningfully to discussions and development
4. Contact the current working group expressing interest

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the MPF community are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
