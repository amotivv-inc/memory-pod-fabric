Memory Pod Fabric (MPF) is an open protocol specification that defines standardized methods for storing, retrieving, and securing semantic memories across AI applications, agents, and organizations.

## üåü Overview

As AI systems become more sophisticated and persistent, the need for standardized, verifiable, and securely shareable memory becomes critical. MPF addresses this challenge by providing a standardized protocol layer that can be implemented across diverse environments while maintaining consistent capabilities.

MPF serves as the essential third pillar in the open agent protocol stack:
- **A2A** lets agents talk to each other
- **MCP** lets models use tools
- **MPF** lets everyone remember

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Standardized API** for memory storage and retrieval
- **Capability-based security** with fine-grained permissions
- **Cryptographic verification** for regulatory compliance
- **Multi-model vector support** for future-proof embeddings
- **Designed for interoperability** with existing AI protocols

## üìö Protocol Specification

The complete protocol specification is available in the [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) file. This specification defines:

- Core memory storage and retrieval operations
- Memory discovery and capability advertising
- Capability-based authorization model
- Cryptographic verification mechanisms
- Integration patterns with existing AI protocols
- Reference data structures and formats

## üöÄ Quick Start

To implement MPF in your project:

1. Review the [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) to understand the protocol
2. Explore the [examples](examples/) directory for implementation samples (coming soon)
3. Choose a reference implementation or create your own following the specification
4. Implement the core endpoints required for MPF compliance

## üß† Core Concepts

### Memory Pod

A Memory Pod is a logical boundary of memory with its own governance, access controls, and audit trail. A pod represents a collection of memory objects that share common access patterns and security requirements.

### Memory Object

A Memory Object is the fundamental unit of storage in MPF, containing vector embeddings, metadata, content, and access control information.

### Capability Tokens

MPF uses signed JWT tokens that implement the object-capability security model for fine-grained access control with specific, time-limited permissions.

### Merkle Verification

MPF uses cryptographic audit trails through Merkle trees, providing tamper-evident verification for regulatory compliance and trust.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guidance

MPF can be implemented on various storage backends:

- **Postgres + pgVector**: Recommended for self-hosted deployments
- **Snowflake VECTOR**: Ideal for enterprise deployments
- **Specialized vector DBs**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, etc.
- **Multi-tier storage**: Hot/warm/cold storage separation

For detailed implementation guidance, see the [implementation guide](docs/implementation-guide.md).

## üì¶ Reference Implementations

Official reference implementations will be available in multiple languages:

- [Python SDK](https://github.com/amotivv/memory-pod-sdk-py)
- [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/amotivv/memory-pod-sdk-ts)
- [Postgres Reference Server](https://github.com/amotivv/memory-pod-postgres)

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions to the MPF specification and reference implementations. Please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to participate.

## üèõÔ∏è Governance

The MPF protocol is governed by a community working group that includes representatives from various organizations. For more information on governance and the decision-making process, see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## üìÑ License

This specification is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

The Apache 2.0 license provides patent protections that make it ideal for an open protocol:
- Explicit patent grant from contributors
- Defensive termination provisions
- Compatible with commercial use
- Industry standard for open protocols

## üîí Security

For information about the security model and best practices, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). For reporting security vulnerabilities, please follow the process outlined in the security document.
